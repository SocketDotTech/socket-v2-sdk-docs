# Intro

Socket aims to unify the multichain ecosystem by connecting all chains and enabling seamless asset & information transfer b/w them. It acts as a metalayer that gives protocols seamless connectivity across chains & enables developers to build unified apps with shared liquidity & state across chains.
Developers can access the Socket metalayer via easy to use APIs & build apps with interoperability as a core part of app infrastructure. With Socket, devs can program bespoke liquidity & information movement b/w all of their app instances & go truly multichain!
